## Creating this project

What follows is a list of steps to create a NextJS website.

1. The first thing to do is to import the starter repo to [learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

``` shell
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```

If the previous command doesn't download the required packages—it should—execute:

``` shell
npm install
```

> Remember that to run npm commands you have to download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
